# Postman_collections

This collection will have the documents of multiple Postman Scenarios. I will keep on updating/uploading the new documents for different postman collection.

Date - 11/06/2023 - Postman_Batch_Request.pdf is uploaded which can be helpful to replicate batch job scenario.

Date - 11/06/2023 - Pre-request Script.pdf is uploaded which can be reffered to understand the use of Pre-Request Script in Postman.

Please reach out to me for any queries/suggestions at
pareshmundale07@gmail.com or
https://www.linkedin.com/in/paresh-mundale-b5a673130/

I will be available to assist on the topics related to automation, scripting, integration etc.


Note - This series/repository expects to make some of the unexplored/less explored options streamlined so that it can be helpful for the beginners to understand and implement.
       By no means I am claiming this will be the best way to implement that specific task.

Thank you!
